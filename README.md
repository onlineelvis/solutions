### exercise 1
### checkArray function
Function checks dose array starts and ends with different parity. If array starts with odd number then should end with even number and opposite.
### findOddEvenPair function
Function count have many pairs (1;2 = oddEvenPair) was in an array.

### exercise 2
### class SummationService && function sum
class called SummationService, with a constructor accepting a non-empty
array of integers as its single argument, and one public method sum() accepting
two non-negative integers $a and $b as arguments, and returning an integer
containing the sum of the array elements with indices from $a to $b (inclusive).

### exercise 3
### longestSubstr function
Given a string of lower- and upper-case Latin letters and digits as an input, the
function returns its longest substring that does not include any

### exercise 1
### maxProfit function
Takes array, returns integer;
Compute the maximum profit that could be made from selling purchased PRODUCT in the
given period, as if the seller had perfect information about future prices.
### exercise 2
### stringCost function
Given two strings $from and $to, and integer costs of various operations on strings
(inserting an arbitrary single character, removing an arbitrary single character
and replacing a single character with another single character), the function
compute and return the minimum cost of transforming string $from into string $to
using these three operations.
### exercise 3
### incrementalMedian function
The median is the middlemost element of the array when SORTED.  For simplicity,
when an array contains an even number of elements, function will consider the smaller of
the two candidates as the median.  Therefore, the median of 1, 8, 4, 7, 13 is 7,
and the median of 1, 8, 4, 7 would be 4.
